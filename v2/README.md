# World Orogen V2 — tectonic history engine (work in progress)

V2 simulates a planet's **tectonic history** — a supercontinent of cratons breaking up, oceans
opening and closing, continents colliding — in the spirit of Worldbuilding Pasta's GPlates
workflow, fully automated and in the browser. It lives beside V1 and never touches it; it imports
V1's generic modules (`js/sphere-mesh.js`, `js/rng.js`, `js/simplex-noise.js`) instead of copying them.

The design, the phase plan and the decision log are in
[`plans/V2_TECTONIC_HISTORY_DESIGN.md`](../plans/V2_TECTONIC_HISTORY_DESIGN.md). Read §3–§4 and §10
before changing the engine.

**Status:** Phases 1–7 are built — rigid kinematics · ridges & trenches · the generated start world · plate
driving forces · collisions (belts, suturing with redraw) · trench wings, island arcs, terrane docking · rifting,
foundering margins, oceanic plate birth · hotspots & LIPs · margins, flat slabs, back-arc seas, fore-arc islands · the
crust budget: erosive margins, continental underthrusting, arc recycling. Phase 8 (terrain) is under way: **8a**, the
tectonic surface — heights from the records, with ridges laid out along each belt's front — is built; 8b (rivers
carve it) is next. The phase table is in the design doc (§9). V2 is built **one phase at a time, each confirmed by
the developer before the next begins.**

## Running it

```
node tuning/dev-server.mjs 8123        # any static server works; there is no build step
open http://localhost:8123/v2/         # the lab; ?phase=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5b, 6a, 7a, 7b, 7c, 8a; &seed=…, &scene=india, &mobility=3.5 …
```

The lab is a test bench, not the product: each phase has a scene that isolates one mechanism, an
on-screen checklist of what to look for, live numbers, and a time scrubber. Space = play/pause,
← → = step a frame. It works on a phone (bottom sheet, tap to inspect). From 8a on the lab draws terrain on a finer
mesh than the sim's (a drop-down: 160K / 640K / 2.5M cells) and has a **Cross-section** tool: click two points.

```
node v2/tools/check-phase1.mjs         # … 2, 3, 4, 5, 5b, 6, 6b, 7, 7b, 7c, 8a — headless acceptance checks, PASS/FAIL, exit code
node v2/tools/check-invariants.mjs     # invariants through whole histories: land never vanishes, dead plates empty, terrane ids, cratons
node v2/tools/check-scale.mjs          # the same scenes at 40K and 80K cells agree in km / km² / Myr; recording rate never changes a history
node v2/tools/trace-forces.mjs india mobility=3.5     # speeds / force-balance targets / situations over time
node v2/tools/trace-collisions.mjs wilson 160          # collision records, events, belt statistics
node v2/tools/render-frames.mjs tug plates            # PNG frames of a scene → v2/out/
node v2/tools/shoot-lab.mjs 4 56 http://localhost:8123 scene=india   # screenshots + page smoke test (needs the server)
```

After an engine change run `check-invariants.mjs`, `check-scale.mjs` and the check scripts of the phases the change
touches; run all of them before calling a piece of work done. They need `npm install` (delaunator, pngjs; puppeteer
only for `shoot-lab`).

## How the engine is put together

1. **Crust lives in plate frames.** Each plate owns a raster over the same sim mesh, in its *own* frame, plus a
   rotation. Moving a plate changes one quaternion; crust is not resampled as it moves, so continents stay rigid.
   The **world view** (`world.owner` / `ownerCell`: who is where) is rebuilt by *gather*: each world cell asks each
   plate "do you have crust here?". No claim = a gap, two = convergence.
2. **Continents first.** Only land is a primary moving object. The pre-history ocean is one passive plate that
   never moves, never pushes back and never accepts crust (a trench against it first carves a real plate out of
   it). New ocean crust is written into the rasters of the plates flanking a gap.
3. **A step** (`simulate.js`):
   `advance` (move by ω·dt) → `resolve` (subduct overlaps by the polarity rule, grow crust into gaps: the world view
   is now fresh) → `classifyBoundaries` (ridge / trench / transform / collision; trench slab records; Andean belts)
   → **events**, in this order — `updateHotspots` (first: it only stamps records) · `trackCollisions` · `growWings`
   · `buildArcs` · `collapseArcs` · `growMarginIsles` · `riftContinents` · `openBackArcs` · `initiateSubduction` ·
   `tidyPlates` → if any changed crust: refresh, `resolve` and classify again → `drive` (next velocities: a scene's
   prescribed motion, or `updatePlateMotion`) → `steerBackArcStrips`. `evolveHeights` (erosion of the height records,
   below) runs before `drive`. Steps are adaptive (a plate moves at most a
   cell per step) and never cross a multiple of `stepGridMyr`, so how often a history is recorded never changes it.
4. **Forces come from boundary state**, not velocities: trench flags, crust type and age, slab length. `D·ω = T` per
   plate, with basal drag, slab resistance and a viscous collision lock in `D`. Speeds are never scripted.
5. **Rasters are rigid — except at a suture.** The one time crust is deformed is when two plates weld
   (`ops/merge-plates.js`: the lower is resampled into the upper's frame and the outlines are redrawn).
6. **Frames are the only interface downstream.** Views, stat panels and checks read `Frame`s (`snapshot.js`), the
   helpers in `measure.js`, and the event log; nothing downstream reaches into plate rasters.
7. **Belts record their geometry** for the terrain: every cell a belt shapes keeps where across the belt it lies
   (`beltU`, 0 at the front), how far the belt reached, which side of a collision it is on and the obliquity of the
   convergence (`crust.belt*`, written by `spreadBelt`). Scalars in the plate frame, so they never need rotating; the
   ridge direction is recovered at terrain time (straight away from the nearest front cell). When a newer orogeny
   takes a cell over, the old belt's record moves to `crust.prev*` (one layer deep), and the terrain shows it under
   the new one.
8. **Heights evolve with the history** (`step/heights.js`; records only — the history never reads them, and its event
   log is the same with or without them). Each crust cell carries an erodible root (`rootKm`, grown exactly as belts
   thicken the crust; Airy isostasy), a broad uplift (`upliftKm`, raised toward the belt's cross-section at the pace of
   the convergence its front absorbs, never lowered by a newer belt; foreland basins sink below 0), the size of its
   belts' crests (`rugged`, `prevRugged`) and a hotspot volcano's wear (`volcWornKm`). Every step erodes them at the
   latitude the cell is at then (faster where it rains more, and poleward under ice) and smooths the uplift sideways a
   little, never into the sea nor onto a craton. So orogenies accumulate, and an old belt that drifted through the
   tropics keeps the wear it took there. Constants: terrain-config.js (`upliftBuildKm`, `reliefTauMyr`,
   `thickTauMyr`, `ruggedTauMyr`, `diffusionKm2PerMyr`); a world may carry its own in `world.config.heights`.

### Rules for event stages and ops (break these and histories go subtly wrong)

- **The world view goes stale during the events.** It was built before them; every stage after the first that
  changes crust makes it stale for the plates involved. An op that adds, removes or rewrites a plate's cells calls
  `plate.markReshaped()`; a stage that reads `world.owner` / `ownerCell` skips plates with `plate.reshaped` (or
  re-checks the plate's own raster, `crust.mask[cell]`). `resolve` clears it. Changing a cell's type in place
  (an arc, an island) only sets `dirty`.
- **Dead plates.** A merged / swallowed plate has `alive = false` and an empty raster; a stage that works on pairs it
  found at the start of the step re-checks `alive` before using either plate.
- **Land is never deleted.** Moving land onto land stacks it beside (`freeCellBeside`) or, only if there is no
  room, absorbs it — counted and reported. `check-invariants.mjs` fails on a step that loses land.
- **Every per-cell field** is in `CELL_FIELDS` (model/crust.js); copy cells with `copyFrom` / `snapshot` / `restore`,
  never field by field.
- **Terrane ids** are unique in a world and never remapped: new ones come from `world.nextTerraneId()`.
- **A stage returns a count** (cells or events changed); the loop sums them to decide whether to re-resolve, so
  `undefined` would silently skip it.

### Adding a mechanism (an event stage)

1. Its code in `step/<name>.js` (plate surgery in `ops/`); call it from the event list in `simulate.js` at the place
   whose inputs it needs, with a comment on what it reads and changes.
2. Its own random stream on `TectonicWorld` (`this.rngX = makeRng(seed ^ 0x…)`) — never another mechanism's, or
   adding it re-rolls every existing history.
3. Tunables in a titled group of `config.js`, in km / Myr / cm·yr⁻¹ (scale-invariant: rates × dt, per km or km²,
   hops only via `km / edgeKm`); its **off-switch in `MECHANISMS`** (config.js), so every older scene excludes it.
4. Its events: a new `EventKind` (model/world.js) with the fields of its `data`, and an `EVENT_STYLE` entry
   (app/phases/phase-kit.js). Code reads `kind` and `data`, never `text`.
5. A new crust type, flag, orogeny or volcanic type: the enum in model/crust.js, then its colour and name in
   view/palettes.js (`TYPE_RGB`, `OROGENY_RGB` + `OROGENY_NAME`, …) and its line in `describeCell` (phase-kit.js).
6. A scene that isolates it, a lab phase and a check script (below); `check-scale.mjs` gains a line if it builds
   something with a size.

### Adding a phase

1. Describe it to the developer and get a go-ahead (phase gate).
2. Engine code as above; a test scene under `scenarios/` that isolates the mechanism with `onlyMechanisms(…)` and is
   *unfair* (unequal speeds, off-centre geometry, several seeds).
3. `js/app/phases/phase<N>-….js` exporting `createPhase(simMesh, seed, overrides)`; the contract is the `Phase`
   typedef in `phase-kit.js` (`assertPhaseContract` enforces it). Use the kit: `SNAPSHOT_MYR`, `describeCell`,
   `eventRows`, `speedSeries`, `orogenyLegend`, `boundaryLegend`, `latLonOf`. Register it in `PHASES` in
   `lab-main.js` and move `LATEST_PHASE` to it.
4. `tools/check-phase<N>.mjs` on `lib/check-kit.mjs`: numeric checks whose expectations do **not** come from the code
   path under test, that fail when the feature is absent (no `every` over an empty list), ending with
   `checkLabPhaseLoads(...)`.
5. Update the design doc (§9 status table, §10 log) and stop for confirmation.

A new **layer**: a painter in view/palettes.js, its colours there, a `{ label, paint }` entry in each phase that shows
it, and legend rows from the same colour constants.

## Terrain (Phase 8)

`synthesizeTerrain(frame, simMesh, terrainMesh)` turns one Frame into heights (km above sea level) on a terrain mesh
of any size — the sim mesh's 121 km cells are far too coarse for ridges. Records are read on the sim mesh
(`records.js`), then every terrain cell blends its three sim cells: the continental platform over land corners, the
sea floor over ocean corners, the land/sea transition from the interpolated signed coast distance (so coasts have a
shape in km, not in cells), each belt kind by its share of the weights. The broad relief is the uplift the history evolved
(engine rule 8), interpolated over land corners; on it, each belt's crests (`profiles.js` crestProfile × the evolved
crest size), plus strike-parallel ridges (`stripes.js`: guidance, a share
of the belt's own uplift) and cones. Belts come in two layers — the current one and the one it overprinted, at half
strength with its own grain — and each corner's share is scaled by noise of its own, so kinds of ground interfinger.
Every erosion clock runs faster where it rains more — a hard-coded zonal-mean rainfall by latitude, with ice keeping
the high latitudes eroding (terrain-config.js rainByLatitude, glacialErosion; erosionAtLatitude), and faster on high
ground than on low (erosionAtHeight): old ranges linger as low hills. Volcanoes are irregular massifs, not cones: an
edifice with a noise-warped outline, broad ridges (rift zones, arc ridges) running out from the summit, gullies in the
lower flanks, sometimes a flank collapse. The fine detail belongs to the crust (`anchor.js`): noise is read in the frame
of the plate under each point, and ridge kernels and volcanoes are keyed to crust cells — scrub the history and a
drifting continent carries its ridges and volcanoes with it. Trapped pockets of
ocean crust smaller than `pocketSeaKm2` are lowland, and a margin's kind (so its shelf width) holds along
`coastKindKm` of its coast. In the lab, the erosion clocks marked "re-runs the history" rebuild the history (in its
worker) with the new constants; the history itself comes out the same. The lab builds the frame shown, then every other
frame in the background (heights only, within a memory budget), so scrubbing and playing need no building; sea level
and hillshade only re-shade.
**Scale invariance:** all lengths are km; noise is a function of position; waves shorter than ~2 terrain cells are
faded out, not aliased. `check-phase8a.mjs` compares 160K, 640K and 2.5M cells sim cell by sim cell.
A phase that draws terrain sets `displayMesh` (its layers paint terrain cells) and may offer `profileAlong` (the
cross-section tool); see the `Phase` typedef in phase-kit.js.

## Performance

Every optimisation so far is EXACT — the output does not change by a single bit — and is checked that way: a hash of
a 600 Myr history's event log and of every frame, and of the terrain's heights, before and after. The history
(single-threaded; steps depend on each other) ran 39 s → 26 s for 600 Myr in Node: precomputed search rings, lookups
skipped for the unrotated background and far from a plate's crust, each plate's lookups reused between the two
resolves of a step, contacts cached per resolve, scratch arrays reused. In the lab it runs in a worker, so the page
never freezes. Terrain is spread over workers (every cell depends only on its position and the per-frame plan):
2.5M cells 5.2 s → ~0.6 s a frame; the terrain mesh is built in a worker while the history runs. Then the lab builds
every other frame ahead, in the background (heights as 16-bit metres, 320 MB at most — 64 MB on small devices): once
built, a frame shows in ~0.15–0.35 s at 640K and ~0.4 s at 2.5M in Chrome (re-shading only).

## Conventions

- **Scale invariance.** Everything is in km / Myr / cm·yr⁻¹. Never a bare hop count: `withinKm` for a distance
  guarantee, `Math.round(km / mesh.edgeKm)` where a hop count is really meant. The history always runs on the fixed
  sim mesh (`simCells`), independent of render detail — but `check-scale.mjs` holds the rules to it.
- **Config.** `new TectonicWorld(simMesh, seed, overrides)` → `world.config` (a deep copy of `TECTONICS`). Engine code
  reads `world.config`, never the defaults. Scenes and lab phases also set `world.config` keys after `build()`: that
  only works for keys read while the history runs, not for ones read while building the world.
- **Determinism.** All randomness comes from seeded streams (`makeRng`), one per mechanism; no `Math.random`, no
  random-comparator sorts. Same seed → same world in every browser.
- **Scenes** keep their own data in `plate.scene`; look plates up by name, never by index; events give plates by id.
- **Provisional cells.** A world cell that no raster holds crust for is marked, never disguised
  (`Provisional.NEWBORN` = ridge axis, `LIKE_NEIGHBOUR` = passing hole ahead of a closing edge).
- **Debugging crust growth:** `decideBirth(world, plate, cell, everyone)` in `step/resolve.js` returns `{born, why}`.
